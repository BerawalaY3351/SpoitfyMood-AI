MoodTunes 🎵 - AI vs. ML Music Recommendation System
MoodTunes is an experimental project where I compare Machine Learning (ML) and OpenAI's GPT for mood-based music recommendations using Spotify API.
This repository contains two versions of the project:

ML Version 🧠 – Uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on labeled text data to detect mood.
OpenAI GPT Version 🤖 – Uses ChatGPT to analyze user input and determine mood dynamically.
I'm testing both approaches to evaluate their effectiveness and will continue tweaking the Spotify ML model for better results.

Project Overview 🚀

✅ Mood Detection Experiment – Compare ML-based classification vs OpenAI NLP analysis.

✅ Spotify Integration – Fetch random songs that match the detected mood.

✅ Terminal-Based Testing – No UI, just type how you feel and get song recommendations.

✅ Continuous Development – Exploring improvements in ML-based mood classification.

How It Works 🛠️

1. User Input: The program asks, "How are you feeling today?"
2. Mood Detection:
  - ML Version: Uses a pre-trained Random Forest classifier on labeled emotion data.
  - OpenAI Version: Uses GPT-3.5/4 to analyze mood dynamically.
3. Spotify API Search: Fetches random songs matching the detected mood.
4. Terminal Output: Prints the song list with Spotify links.

Future Enhancements 🚀
🔹 Improve ML Training Data – Expand labeled dataset to refine mood classification.

🔹 Custom Playlist Creation – Automate Spotify playlist creation for both versions.

🔹 Deep Learning Mood Detection – Replace ML classifier with a neural network model.

🔹 User Preferences – Train a model based on user-specific music taste.
